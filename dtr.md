**Project: Battleship (Paired project)**

**Group Member Names:** Gus Cunningham and Grayson Myers

**Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):**

Ideally we would like to get through iteration 4 but our primary learning goal is to develop skills for working together, particularly within the context of GitHub pairing.

**Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):**

We're planners and organizers and can use those strengths to help us get organized for the project. Structure comes naturally to Grayson and he can work efficiently over long periods of time. One of Gus's strengths is Lover of Justice, which will help maintain a good balance in terms of work load and making sure both teammates are getting what we need out of the project. We both feel more comfortable working alone but are willing to get out of our comfort zone to achieve our learning goals for the project.

**How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:**

Grayson has a stronger technical background with coding and feels confident solving coding problems. Gus is comfortable checking in/and or starting conversations to make sure we're on the same page about how we are working together to help avoid any conflicts around schedule or workload.

**Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have? Make sure to discuss the remote questions above in regards to this section):**

We're both fairly flexible and don't anticipate any scheduling conflicts outside of scheduled class activities.

**Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team? How will we communicate about our emotional and mental well-being with each other?):**

We plan to focus on working together as much as possible, making daily use of slack to coordinate scheduling as needed. We'll work to maintain open communication about emotional and mental needs, and to respect one anothers' needs for more/less breaks, etc.

**Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):**

Since this is new material for Gus his primary technical focus will be implementing the skills we learn in class. Both Grayson and Gus will focus on learning to use GitHub as a tool for group work and acquiring the technical skills needed to do so effectively.

**Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):**

Since our primary focus is to learn to work together we're not anticipating needing to divide up specific project tasks to be worked on by either one of us as individuals. We will aim to achieve equal driver/navigator time and to have a roughly equal amount of commits and pull requests.

**Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques):**

We're aiming to create new branches for each feature as we work on it, and work on most code together, and to hopefully do some ping-pong style partner branching when we get to iteration 4.

**Pomodoro Break Schedule:**

We will try working in 1 hour increments and adjust as needed.

**Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:**

We will make an effort to give each other feedback as we are working and will plan to discuss feedback explicitly when we meet on Friday to re-DTR. We'll also aim to make use of comments on pull requests through GitHub.

**Additional Remote Considerations:**

We don't anticipate any issues related to remote work but we'll check in on Friday to see if anything has come up.

**Project management tools we will use (GitHub projects or Trello are popular tools):**

GitHub projects

**Day 1 Agenda:**

We'll take some time today to read through the requirements and meet this evening to come up with a skeleton plan of attack.
